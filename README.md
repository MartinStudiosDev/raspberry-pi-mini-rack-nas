# Raspberry Pi 5 Mini NAS Enclosure

![Raspberry Pi 5 Mini NAS Enclosure](images/hero.png)

## Overview
This project documents a compact enclosure designed to house a Raspberry Pi 5 and two 2.5” SSDs in a clean, modular form factor. While intended primarily as a small NAS platform, the enclosure is suitable for a variety of lightweight networking and computing applications.

The focus of this design is simplicity, serviceability, and efficient use of space rather than maximum storage density.

---

## Design Summary
- Supports **Raspberry Pi 5**
- Holds **two 2.5” SSDs**
- Compact, stacked internal layout
- Designed for external power via USB-C
- Modular tray-based assembly

The enclosure is optimized for small homelab and personal server use where aesthetics, footprint, and accessibility matter.

---

## Hardware Compatibility
- **Raspberry Pi 5** (recommended)
- **2 × 2.5” SATA SSDs** (via USB-to-SATA adapters)

> Note: Raspberry Pi 4 may fit physically, but cannot reliably power two SSDs and is not recommended for this configuration.

---

## Enclosure Layout
The enclosure consists of modular trays that allow flexible internal arrangement. The Raspberry Pi tray must be installed in the first slot to align correctly with the external power cutout. SSD trays can be rearranged as needed.

Two side panel options are used:
- One panel with a USB-C power cutout
- One solid panel without a cutout
